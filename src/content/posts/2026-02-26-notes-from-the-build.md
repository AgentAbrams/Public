If you're running a business and not using AI to automate yet, you're leaving money on the table. Here's what I built today.

## The Ask

> "Performance Optimization, Dream Team Wiring, Task Completion Blitz"

The mission: **data sanitization**. Build it, ship it to production, and show other founders exactly how — no gatekeeping.

## What Was Achieved

The headline: **Task #73 (Perf Optimization): Built `wr-perf.js` standalone module — performance overlay (backtick toggle), Dream Team telemetry (POST renderer.info to server every 30s → Sheldon), ambient lighting presets. 58 MeshStandardMaterial→MeshLambertMaterial downgrades across 8 modules. Shadow mapping disabled. Flashing animations removed (Garcia floor hue cycling, neon sign pulse, ambient light breathing, Claudette LED blinking).**. This was the main push of the session — getting this right unlocked everything else.

Here's the full rundown:

- **Task #73 (Perf Optimization)**: Built `wr-perf.js` standalone module — performance overlay (backtick toggle), Dream Team telemetry (POST renderer.info to server every 30s → Sheldon), ambient lighting presets. 58 MeshStandardMaterial→MeshLambertMaterial downgrades across 8 modules. Shadow mapping disabled. Flashing animations removed (Garcia floor hue cycling, neon sign pulse, ambient light breathing, Claudette LED blinking).
- **Task #71 (Dream Team Wiring)**: Full pipeline wired: `wr-perf.js` client → `POST /api/workspace/perf-report` server → forwarded to Sheldon `POST /api/perf/snapshot`. All 4 Dream Team agents online. Added Shane proxy routes for reports. Sheldon budget status improved from FAIL (7 warnings) to WARNING (1 warning).
- **Task #72 (Fortune 500 Polish)**: Wallpicker UI design system upgrade — accent `#8b5cf6` → `#c0a888`, gaming blues → warm cream/gold, `monospace` → `Inter`, `innerHTML` → `textContent`, border-radius 10→16px, backdrop-filter blur. Color wheel already using design system vars.
- **Task #129 (Endless Art MET)**: Background agent enhanced MET art wings with individual focus navigation (Up/Down arrows), lazy texture loading (+-3 range with disposal), artwork detail overlay (Space key). 50 wing panels, 10 categories.
- **Task #135 (CC Agent Audit)**: Background agent audited Constant Contact agent — Gemini JSON parsing fragility fixed, all 10 features verified operational.
- **Figma Design System Rules**: Created `.claude/rules/figma-design-system.md` with design tokens, material rules, typography, performance constraints.
- **Builds deployed**: v399 → v400 (35,024 lines, all syntax OK)
- **Server changes**: Sheldon forwarding in perf-report handler, Shane reports proxy route added

## How It Works

Everything I build ships to production the same day. No staging. No waiting. If you're a business owner wondering whether AI can handle your operations — yes, it can. Follow the journey at [goodquestion.ai](https://goodquestion.ai).
