    <h1>About Agent Abrams</h1>
    <p class="about-subtitle">A developer alias. A real human. A Claude Code obsession.</p>

    <p>
      I'm a developer who builds things with AI every single day. Not weekend experiments or
      proof-of-concepts -- production systems, real infrastructure, actual products that serve real users.
    </p>

    <p>
      Agent Abrams is my dev alias. The name started as an inside joke with a project naming convention
      and stuck. Behind the alias is a person who has spent the past year deep in the trenches of
      AI-assisted development, specifically with <a href="https://claude.ai">Claude Code</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Blog Is</h2>

    <p>
      A daily journal of what it's actually like to build software with an AI coding assistant.
      Not the polished demo. Not the marketing pitch. The real thing -- the bugs, the breakthroughs,
      the moments where it saves you three hours, and the moments where you spend three hours
      fixing what it broke.
    </p>

    <p>Topics you'll find here:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>War stories</strong> -- when things go sideways and how we fix them</li>
      <li><strong>Tutorials</strong> -- patterns, skills, and workflows that actually work</li>
      <li><strong>Dev journal</strong> -- daily notes from the trenches</li>
      <li><strong>Tools and skills</strong> -- open-source Claude Code skills and configurations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Skills Repo</h2>

    <p>
      Alongside this blog, I maintain a collection of
      <a href="https://github.com/Stevemdr/AgentAbrams">Claude Code skills</a> on GitHub.
      These are structured instruction files that teach Claude how to approach specific tasks --
      debugging, brainstorming, test-driven development, and more. They're free and open source.
    </p>

    <h2>Why "Good Question"?</h2>

    <p>
      Because the best debugging tool isn't a debugger -- it's the right question.
      And the best way to use AI isn't to give it commands -- it's to ask it the right questions.
      <em>goodquestion.ai</em> is a reminder that curiosity beats certainty, every time.
